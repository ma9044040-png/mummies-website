            <h2>I. The Mortuary Sciences</h2>
            <p>Ancient Egyptians were the world's first biologists. They didn't wrap bodies for fun; they were trying to turn a human into a "Vessel for Eternity." If the body rotted, the soul became a "lost ghost."</p>

                    <h3>The Bio-Chemistry of Natron</h3>
                    <p>They used <strong>Natron</strong> (a mix of salt and baking soda). It wasn't just a surface dry-out; it worked at a cellular level to stop the enzymes that cause rotting. They stuffed the body with spice-soaked linen to keep the shape, because without it, the body would collapse like a deflated balloon.</p>

                    <h3>The Organ Extraction</h3>
                    <p>The priests used a bronze hook to whisk the brain and pull it out the nose (gross, but effective!). They kept the <strong>Heart</strong> inside the body, believing it was the center of intelligence. The rest went into <strong>Canopic Jars</strong> guarded by the sons of Horus.</p>
